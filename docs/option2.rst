Option 2: Power an Application
==============================
You may not want to expose workflows to end-users via the automatical web forms.  However, you can use the :doc:`./API/api_funcs` and `blend4php <https://github.com/galaxyproject/blend4php>`_ to directly integrate with Galaxy through your own Tripal application.  To do so, please visit the :doc:`./API/api_overview` pages for more details. 

An example application that uses this approach is the `Cartogratree <https://treegenesdb.org/ct>`_ application available on the `TreeGenes <https://treegenesdb.org>`_ website.
